# PCB Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

- My business card, with minimal information and an NFC that shines, in PCB.
- Designed using EasyEDA Pro.
- The "EasyEDA multi-color silkscreen" option is supported only by JLCPCB.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
